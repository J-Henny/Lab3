### **Lab Status**

```
Compiles and runs with some errors. 

### **Discussion**
_What did you learn about backtracking?_
Backtracking can be an effective method to retrace steps if your stack functions hit a dead end. 
```text
Backtracking is a great way to demonstrate the relationship
between recursion and stacks. Both methods are used to determine
three possible outcomes:
    1. Reach end of list
    2. Reach a node which has no path forward
    3. Move around in an endless loop
```
